      <p>Kathleen Franco is the owner of Kathleen Franco, P.C. and Dynamic Resolutions Mediation Services. Her private practice consists of representing family law clients using the collaborative family law model. This model helps lawyers and clients achieve effective resolution in divorce without litigation. Kathleen continues to devote a very small portion of her practice to litigation. She also mediates dissolution and post-decree issues.</p>
      <p>Kathleen is a member of the Colorado Bar Association, the Boulder County Bar Association, International Academy of Collaborative Professions, and the Collaborative Divorce Professionals of Boulder.</p>
      <p>Ms. Franco received her dual J.D. and MBA degrees at the University of Denver in 1983. Her legal career began in 1983 in the Public Defenderâ€™s office representing criminal defendants. Kathleen also worked as a corporate litigator before settling down in her first private practice, which consisted of divorce and family law, and personal injury.</p>
      <p>Kathleen was on 20/20 as a result of a civil case she tried in Denver District Court. After taking a few years off, studying and teaching Yoga, Taoism and Buddhism, Kathleen began her current practice in Boulder in 2000.</p>
      <p>She has conducted several trainings for lawyers in the collaborative model since 2001, and was a mediation trainer at the NITA conference in 2006. Kathleen held a part-time contract position as mediator with the Colorado Judicial Department Office of Dispute Resolution from 2000-2007.</p>
